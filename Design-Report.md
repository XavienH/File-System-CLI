# Design Report HW3

### Directory
This class is equivalent to a "node" in the construction of a tree with most of the getters, setters, searches, find, lists created for the File and Link class, etc. located in this class.

### File
As its name suggest, it is meant to store the file's name and contents of the file.

### Link
This was created for the sake of the bonus which organized the target directory, target name and link name inside the class which could later be an instance used in par with the Directory class to be "linked" with the target.
